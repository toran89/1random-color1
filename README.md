# 1random-color1
project no 1

Well just for my reminder this is my first time adding readme.file after uploadin project i thought now cant add description so added learning in comments haha. but that isnot visible now anywhere. 

1. till now i never used a method like where u can access any html elements style. for first time changed color of body's background dynamically. (document.body.style.backgroundColor) cool.

2. as usual again forgot to use random index of any array. this time stuck for a while on colorIndex, i was expecting that would change color. haha in reality i had to write more like let randomColor = colorArr[colorIndex]
